- 👋 Hi, I’m @meredith-j
- 👀 I’m interested in theatre, D&D, fashion... as for coding, I love a healthy mix of front end and back end -- currently really enjoying building my plant database for Grow a Pear! 
- 🌱 I’m currently perfecting: React.js, Node.js, MySQL
- 🤓 Next on my list of languages to learn are: React Native.js, Python, MongoDB & Dev Ops
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything full stack!! I thrive on a healthy mix of adjusting padding and building backend routes.
