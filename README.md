👋 Hi, I’m @meredith-j
🌈 My pronouns are they/them.
👀 I’m interested in theatre, D&D, fashion... as for coding, I love a healthy mix of front end and back end -- currently building a plant database (grow a pear) and a playlist-merging platform (tuneup).
🌱 My stack is: HTML, CSS, SASS, JavaScript, React.js, Node.js, Knex.js, Express.js, MySQL.
🤓 Next on my list of languages to learn are: React Native, Python, MongoDB.
💞️ Group projects: let me know if you want help with your project or need a teammate for any online or 📍Toronto-based hackathons! I love group projects & hackathons bring out my competitive side.
